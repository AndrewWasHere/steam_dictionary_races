# STEAM: Dictionary Races and Search Algorithms

Comparing looking words up in the dictionary to computer search algorithms.

## Equipment

* Dictionaries. At minimum, one for each team plus one for the Dictionary
  Race proctor. They should all be the same edition.
* Deck of cards. I use giant stage cards, but a regular deck will also work.
* Stands for the cards (optional). The pen tray on a whiteboard works well.
* [presenter notes](presenter_notes.md).

## Dictionary Races Rules

1. Dictionaries start closed, on the table.
2. The proctor opens her dictionary to a random page, choose a word, and
   says it out loud.
3. Once it's verified everyone knows the word, The proctor will say "Ready?
   Go!" and the players search for the word as quickly as possible. When a
   player finds the word, the player raises his hand, and say "got it", or
   the equivalent, to get the proctor's attention.
4. When the player is called on, the player should say the word, say the page
   number that the word is on, spell the word, and read the first definition.
   If the player is correct, he or his team gets a point. If the player is
   incorrect, play resumes, and the next player to raise their hand gets a
   chance.
5. Once the correct word and definition are found, dictionaries are closed,
   and play starts again. If playing in teams, players rotate each turn.

## Post Mortem

This was not one of the most engaging STEAM activities I've done. Reaction
from the students was wide ranging, from the ultra-competitive, win-at-all-
costs, to those that did not want to participate. Third graders are not
all that good at looking things up in the dictionary, either. At least not
at the beginning of the school year.

I tried to make things more interesting by using my [Game Show]() web app to
keep score, and [Game Show Buzzers]() Android app for the students to ring in 
on. I don't think it made much difference.

In the end, the project-based activities seem to go over with the students
better.
