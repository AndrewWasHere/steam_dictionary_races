# STEAM: Dictionary Races and Search Algorithms

Comparing looking words up in the dictionary to computer search algorithms.

## Equipment

* Dictionaries. At minimum, one for each team plus one for the presenter. They
  should all be the same edition.
* Deck of cards. I use giant stage cards, but a regular deck will also work.
* Stands for the cards (optional). I made mine out of aluminum c-channel and
  magnets from a hardware store that attached to the classroom whiteboard.
