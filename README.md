# STEAM: Dictionary Races and Search Algorithms

Comparing looking words up in the dictionary to computer search algorithms.

## Equipment

* Dictionaries. At minimum, one for each team plus one for the Dictionary
  Race proctor. They should all be the same edition.
* Deck of cards. I use giant stage cards, but a regular deck will also work.
* Stands for the cards (optional). I made mine out of aluminum c-channel and
  magnets from a hardware store that attached to the classroom whiteboard.

## Dictionary Races Rules

1. Dictionaries start closed, on the table.
2. The proctor opens her dictionary to a random page, choose a word, and 
   says it out loud.
3. Once it's verified everyone knows the word, The proctor will say "Ready? 
   Go!" and the players search for the word as quickly as possible. When a
   player finds the word, the player raises his hand, and say "got it", or 
   the equivalent, to get the proctor's attention.
4. When the player is called on, the player should say the word, say the page 
   number that the word is on, spell the word, and read the first definition.
   If the player is correct, he or his team gets a point. If the player is 
   incorrect, play resumes, and the next player to raise their hand gets a 
   chance.
5. Once the correct word and definition are found, dictionaries are closed,
   and play starts again. If playing in teams, players rotate each turn.
